# OmniAuth Contrib

Welcome to the **temporary** holding zone for OmniAuth strategies that
have been converted to OmniAuth 1.0 but haven't yet had an adoptive open
source parent convert them into a real boy (er, gem).

## Interested in Adopting a Strategy?

Are you pretty familiar with one of the strategies listed on this site?
Would you like to be the official maintainer of a gem for that strategy
and support its future updates? Please file an issue on this repository
saying you'd like to adopt the strategy and we can discuss how to spin
it out.

Adopting a strategy also means that you should be willing to write some
tests to make sure everything's working, and that hundreds or thousands
of people may end up using it on a daily basis. It's a big
responsibility but also very rewarding!
